 * * The size() of a HostProvider may never be zero.
 * 
 * A HostProvider must return resolved InetSocketAddress instances on next(),
 * but it's up to the HostProvider, when it wants to do the resolving.

 * 
 * * A HostProvider that loads the list of Hosts from an URL or from DNS 
 * * A HostProvider that re-resolves the InetSocketAddress after a timeout. 
 * * A HostProvider that prefers nearby hosts.
